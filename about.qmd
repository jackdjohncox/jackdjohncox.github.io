### **About Me**

I’m a Research Associate with the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center at Texas State University, where I focus on turning data into life-saving strategies for first responders. My work bridges research and real-world application to improve officer performance, decision-making, and community safety.

My recent projects have explored topics like stress responses in virtual reality training, civilian perceptions of use of force, and active attacks involving motor vehicles. Before moving into research, I worked as a Logistics Specialist at ALERRT, helping coordinate large-scale training deployments across the country.

I earned my undergraduate degree in Criminal Justice from Texas State University, where I am currently enrolled in the Masters of Science Criminal Justice program.

My recent publications include:

-   *“Active Attacks with Motor Vehicles: A Short Report and Case Study of the 2025 New Year’s Day Attack in New Orleans, LA”* — *American Journal of Criminal Justice (2025)*

-   *“\@#%\$!: The Impact of Officer Profanity on Civilians’ Perception of What Constitutes Reasonable Use of Force”* — *Applied Police Briefings (2025)*

-   *“Can a Virtual Reality Training Scenario Elicit a Stress Response Similar to a Realistic Scenario-Based Training Scenario?”* — *Applied Police Briefings (2025)*

I’m passionate about using data to make training more effective and realistic, and ultimately to help save lives. Outside of work, I enjoy strong coffee, technology, and my best Rubik's cube time was 42 seconds.
